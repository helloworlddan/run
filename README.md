Package Run provides useful, yet opinionated integrations for workloads running
on Cloud Run.

## TODO

- Using interfaces for common ops like logging and client/caches maps
- Deal with local develop on GCE, with metadata server available
- Add examples for both jobs and service to this README
- Implement all available logging severities:
  <https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry#LogSeverity>
- Accessing knative spec and exposing config
